<!-- Hi there! I'm [N. Erkam Yildirim] 👋 -->

## About Me 🚀

👋 Hi there! I'm [Erkam], a passionate [data scientist]. I love to explore and create amazing things in the world of [data and machine learning].

🌱 I'm currently [learning AWS Cloud Computing], and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

💼 By day, I'm a [coffee freak], and by night, I'm a [data freak]. 

🌟 Some of my interests include [movie readings], and I'm always up for a good [hike].

## Tech Stack 💻

🛠️ Here are some of the technologies and tools I enjoy working with:

- 💡 [Python]: I'm not sure if I can call myself a Pythonista but I love using Python on personal and team projects. scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy are my go-to packages in Python. 
- 💡 [R]: R will always have a special place in my heart. R has allowed me to do incredible statistical modellings.
- 💡 [SQL]: The efficiency and comfort of SQL is unmatched. I really enjoy extracting data using SQL.  
- 💡 [Tableau]: I learned Tableau online and instantly fell in love with it. Data visualisation is a like a game with Tableau. 

## Projects 🔥

👨‍💻 I'm passionate about working on projects that [arouse my interest]. Here are a few of my favorite projects:

- 🚀 [Predicting Credit Card Approvals]: I ran a machine learning model using logistic regression to create a credit card approval prediction system.
- 🚀 [Android App Market on Google Play]: I analysed different marketing strategies of apps i.e. popularity of paid vs free apps and explored app categories in demand
- 🚀 [Summer of Tech/Create Camp]: My team and I built a platform where dog owners could find dog-friendly places. I was responsible for data sourcing which I have done using Google Plaes API.
